# Web_Scraping_using_Python

This code is to get the list of restaurants, in this case Indian restaurants, from Yelp. I have written two sets of codes, using Beutiful Soup and Using lxml in combination with the xpath. There is some additional cleaning you have to do to get the clean dataset. But its just removing "/n" and spaces, etc. The goal of this excercise was to show two simple use cases.
